## COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Can I do this solo?**
A: Yes! Estimated 210-270 hours total = 6-7 hours/week over 6 months if you have research experience. Adjust timeline if needed.

**Q: What if I don't get SPRINT data?**
A: Proceed with NHANES only. SPRINT is optional enhancement. Plan for 4-8 week delay if approval needed.

**Q: Do I need a team?**
A: Ideal is 2-3 people (data scientist, developer, statistician), but solo is possible with phased timeline.

**Q: What if model performance is poor (C-stat <0.60)?**
A: Plan to add variables (BP variability, medication intensity). Document limitations. Still publishable if methodologically sound.

**Q: Can I publish before month 24?**
A: Yes! Consider preprint (medRxiv) after Week 20 while journal reviews. Faster feedback.

**Q: What's the budget really?**
A: $0 base (all free tools). Optional: conference registration ($500-1500), journal open access ($0-3000). Recommend starting free tier.
